Modern Robotics Color Sensor Example with color number
Created 9/29/2016 by Colton Mehlhoff of Modern Robotics using FTC SDK 2.2
Reuse permitted with credit where credit is due

Configuration:
I2CDevice "cc" (MRI Color Sensor with default I2C address 0x3c (0x1e 7-bit)

ModernRoboticsI2cColorSensor class is not being used because it can not access color number.
ColorSensor class is not being used because it can not access color number.
